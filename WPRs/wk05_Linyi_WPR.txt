Weekly Report

What I do:
1) Prepare a simple version project schedule for the project.
2) Search using internal MCU clock or external crystal oscillator, and their differences.


Next:
1) Write the userprogram.
2) Help Andrew to write the code to display information on LCD.

Issue:
Not sure the frequency and its accuracy for this project, which decide to use external clock or internal clock.
