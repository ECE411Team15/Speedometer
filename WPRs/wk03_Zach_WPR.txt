Weekly report -- Week 3

DONE:

- Created breakout dev board for individual pin access of MCU
- Ordered cable and connectors for sensor module
- Created folder structure for GitHub page.
- Researched possible battery choices.

ISSUES:

- The pins of the MCU are very small. It's roughly dime-sized and there are 48 pins. The routed dev board came out looking clean but it will be difficult to solder the chip onto it, and the traces might have a tendency to lift.
- I'm worried that a coin battery that we were hoping to use may not be able to source enough current to power the screen and the MCU.
- It seems clear that the sensors we're looking at need to run at 3.3V or greater, otherwise they have a tendency to drop out and lose range.

ACTION ITEMS:

- (ongoing) Find a suitable power arrangement. I'd like to have overhead voltage available and regulate it down to 3.3V if possible. This will result in the best performance over a longer time frame.
- (ongoing) Think about various form factor issues, e.g. an enclosure for the hall effect sensors, how to mount screen above PCB, how things mount to an enclosure in general.
