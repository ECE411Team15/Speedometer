Week of 10/25/2017

1.) As mentioned in the issues of the last WPR, I have pushed out writing the high level algorithm.
    a.) It is also better for me to push out the algorithm so I may focus on having a basic prototype working.
2.) Programmed interrupts in test program. 
    Tested interrupts with a push button, works as expected.
3.) Wired a working prototype. Will now be able to easily work on the code at home. 

Next Week:
11/1/2

1.) Get a working prototype going for the mph conversion algorithm. 
2.) Get mph displaying on lcd screen.
    a.) Need to write functions which write/read to LCD display.
3.) Begin HW4
4.) Get a document review meeting together so we may discuss the schedule. 

Issues:

1.) Need to figure out how to pass known state (flag) between interrupt handler and main. 
    a.) Shouldn't be hard to solve, just need to dedicate time to it. 
2.)
