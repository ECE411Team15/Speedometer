Andrew Capatina


1.) Bought development kit.
2.) Bought LCD display. Will update BOM.
3.) Researched tools/board needed.

Next Week:

  1.) Set up development board.
    a.) Will be using a push button led program to quickly get code working.
  2.) Set up interface to LCD display.
    a.) STMcube mx makes this a lot easier than it seems...


Issues

  1.) I mistakenly bought the MCU at first and didn't realize how valuable
      the development kit would be for this project.
