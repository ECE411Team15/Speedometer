Week of 10/18/2017

1.) Have set up a working push button program to turn on an LED on the development board.
2.) Set up MCU pinout.
3.) Bought and received ST V2 emulator/programmer.

Next Week:
10/25/2017

1.) Write high level algorithm for user interface.
2.) Program LCD to display Hello World Program.


Issues:

1.) Need to figure out how we will be uploading code to the MCU which we will be using for our PCB.
  a.) issue resolved.
2.) I have needed to push out writing the algorithm because I have focused my time on getting the basics to work with our development board.
    This includes having the sensor, button, and talking to the MCU.
