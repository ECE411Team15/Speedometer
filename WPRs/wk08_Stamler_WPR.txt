Weekly report -- Week 8

DONE:

- Finalized/ordered PCB, PCB Solder mask template
- Fabricated sensor modules.
- Ordered/received all remaining parts
- Helped Andrew and Linyi troubleshoot electrical issues with our LCD. It initially was not working, and our backup choice wouldn't run on +3.3V. The problem turned out to be a simple grounding issue with the test setup.

ISSUES:

- Switch caps don't fit our switches (too big inside).
- Sensor modules not closed off at ends/waterproofed yet.


ACTION ITEMS:

- Receive board
- Begin test plan
- Figure out solution for switch cap issue, likely involving lots of epoxy.
- Figure out solution for sensor close-off, also likely involving lots of epoxy.
- Begin bring-up procedure ASAP (probably next week, after the holiday).
