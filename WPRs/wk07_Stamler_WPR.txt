Weekly report -- Week 7

DONE:

- Designed and tested debounce circuit for charge inlet power defeat and tested on the bench. Added same to schematic/layout.
- Re-oriented power reg circuit to maximize distance between the inductor and the rest of the subcircuits on board.
- Other small optimizations on PCB.
- Discussed case design ideas with Linyi.

ISSUES:

- May have to do some substantial re-pinning if Andrew and Linyi can't get all the GPIOs configured properly.
- Need to bring up some design questions about the case with the rest of the group, especially re the placement/orientation of screen and switch.

ACTION ITEMS:

- Finalize layout.
- Order remaining parts.
- Keep track of Linyi's progress on case.
