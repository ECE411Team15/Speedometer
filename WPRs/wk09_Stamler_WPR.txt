Zach Stamler

Weekly report -- Week 9

DONE:

- Took delivery of all remaining parts and supplies for board fab/assembly.
- Helped troubleshoot sensor/board hardware issues while Andrew and Linyi worked on SW development. Kind of like phone support over the holiday.
- Developed test plan with Nathan to use for bringing up board HW.
- Tried to find epoxy-type solution for switch caps.

ISSUES:

- Switch caps still don't fit our switches, even after modification attempts.
- Sensor modules not closed off at ends/waterproofed yet.


ACTION ITEMS:

- Begin board fab/assembly/bring-up
- Either solve switch cap problem, find another solution, or just deal with very short-throw switches.
- Wire up all connectors for sensor modules.
