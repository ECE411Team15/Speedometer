Week of 11/1/2017

1.) Got a working prototype of the speed conversion algorithm. I am able to calculate the change in time
    from one pulse to the next of the hall effect sesnor using Input Capture Mode.
2.) Finished Project Schedule.
3.) Developed low level algorithm for edge detection.

Next Week:
11/8/2017

1.) Refine speed conversion algorithm program.
2.) Finish block diagram homework assignment. (HW5)
3.) Write algorithms for LCD.

Issues:
1.) Need to dedicate time to get LCD working. 
  a.) This is my highest priority concern. We will be ready to integrate the functionality of 
  the peripherals once this is finished.
