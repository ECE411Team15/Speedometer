Weekly report -- Week 6

DONE:

-Finished schematic.
-Finished and ordered breakout boards for the tactile switch.
-Assembled BOM for less easily-aqcuired components (ie not resistors caps, and diodes) for prototyping/subcircuit verification.
-Finished draft PCB layout. 

ISSUES:

-Andrew C says we'll need to change some pinouts on the MCU, this will change the schematic and the layout.
-Need to debate adequacy of top-layer ground plane with Nathan (I think it's fine as-is, he does not).

ACTION ITEMS:

-Meet with Nathan re top ground plane. Finish board layout for Thursday.
-Find out about Andrew's changes to MCU pinout.
-Order prototyping parts.
