Weekly report -- Week 4

DONE:

-Started schematic with Nathan.
-Added switched power reg circuit, MCU power scheme, sensor input circuit to schematic.
-Tested a power button timing circuit in LTSpice and added to schematic.
-Began custom Eagle parts library, will mostly be using SMD parts in 0805 form factor.
-Received single connector set/cable for sensor module.

ISSUES:

-Don't know how we're going to mount the button(s)/screen to the enclosure yet.
-Coin battery way underpowered for the needs of this device. Are researching alternate solution.

ACTION ITEMS:

- Verify pwr button circuit in the lab.
- Decipher MCU pinout connections using document created by Andrew/Linyi, implement in schematic.
- Decide on an input switch arrangement, figure out mounting.
- (ongoing) Find a suitable power arrangement. Need >4V. If we're using rechargeable LIon, need to figure that implementation out ASAP (charge controller/charging method).
- (ongoing) Think about various form factor issues, e.g. an enclosure for the hall effect sensors, how to mount screen above PCB, how things mount to an enclosure in general.
