The low voltages at the 'switching' node represent button presses. Notice the momentary press of ~0.4s is sufficient to turn the output voltage on, but not enough to turn it off. Here, the circuit turns off after a ~1.6s press, but it could be made longer or shorter depending on choice of C3 and R3.
The circuit drives the EN input of the voltage regulator, so it will draw almost no current either on or off.
